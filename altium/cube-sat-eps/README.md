# EPS - Electric Power System

## Project Overview

This project is part of a CubeSat prototype built as a group project at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. [GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.com/wust-satellite)

The primary functions of this board are:

1. **Battery Management**:
    - Charging a 1S Li-ion battery pack using Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT).
    - Monitoring the battery voltage.

2. **Power Conversion**:
    - Generating stable 5V and 3.3V power rails to supply various components of the system.

3. **Communication**:
    - Establishing UART communication with a radio board for data transmission and control.

4. **Deployment of Solar Panels and Radio Antenna**:
    - Providing two power outputs capable of driving high current to external resistors, which can burn wires to deploy the solar panels and antenna.

5. **Remove Before Flight (RBF) Circuit**:
    - Ensuring that the satellite starts operation only after ejection from the launch vehicle.

> [!NOTE]
> Certain features, such as current monitoring and switches on all power lines, were omitted due to time constraints.

## Project Status ✅

The `Electric Power System` has been fully tested, confirming that **all** its intended functions **operate as expected**. The development of both the PCB and the corresponding code is complete, and this specific board is no longer under active development. Notably, the `EPS` was successfully integrated into our `CubeSat` prototype, which was assembled and was operating as planned. It is important to remember that this is a **prototype** and, despite its successful operation, certain features were omitted due to time constraints, as noted earlier. Therefore, this `EPS` design is not yet ready for use in a final `CubeSat` intended for space deployment.
